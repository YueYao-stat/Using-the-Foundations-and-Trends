 Foundations and Trends\textsuperscript{\textregistered} welcomes monographs that touch on fundamental problems in machine learning from theoretical, methodological, and/or computational perspectives. We are particularly interested in monographs that seek to bridge such problems and perspectives with those from related fields, including (but not limited to) statistics, economics, and optimization.
